## 1. About the Study Planner

This is how the calendar looks like:

![](https://github.com/ascheuer-code/StudyPlanner/blob/master/images/Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 10.42.38.png)

You see your Moduls on the left side and the calendar on the right side.

You can choose if you want to see just the day. Then it looks like this:

Or the week:

### How to add a lecture/ learning session

- First step:

You can add a lecture to your timetable while you click on the ***erstelle***
button.

- Second step:

A window will open where you have to choose witch Modul you want to add to your timetable. Then you have to choose if
this event is a part of your ***learning session***
or your ***timetable***. You also have to choose the ***start time*** and the ***end time*** and the ***date***.

![](https://github.com/ascheuer-code/StudyPlanner/blob/master/images/Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 10.43.55.png)- Third step:

If you want, you can create a serie, so you don't have to apply the lecture for every week. Then you have to choose
a ***begin date***, an ***end date*** and how often the lecture should be repeated.

learning session the time you invest in a modul will automatically decrease**

To delete a lecture or a learning session you have to right-click on the entry in your calendar you want to delete. Then
choose to delete.
